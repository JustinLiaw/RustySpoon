# RustySpoon

Direction for Compilation:


1. To get files:
    git clone https://github.com/JustinLiaw/RustySpoon.git

2. To execute the code
    cd RustySpoon/proj_phase1
    cargo run

For Execution:

All code will run all parts at the beginning. If you want to isolate a specific 
part comment out the rest of the sections in main. No function definitions need to
be commented out to run.
